# Collab - my little side project

An AngularJS+Bootstrap+Node.js project, with websocket support (through socket.io) that contains a very simple collaboration tool. For now, this includes:
 - Sign up, login
 - Create a workroom/channel, join an existing workroom, invite another user to a workroom
 - View and add messages in a workroom (real time updates through socket.io)


## Getting Started

Hopefully it's as simple as git clone, npm install, node workplace.js. But then again, nothing is that simple in real life...


## Testing

Oh yeah. That. Do as I say, don't do as I do. My bad.
